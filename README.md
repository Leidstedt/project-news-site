This is a project made made when doing the Technigo bootcamp.
During this project we should learn;
- Structure webpages using boxmodel
- Layout webpages using flexbox
- Create responsive webpages for mobile, desktop and tablet

## The problem

I used flexbox as a layout model for the page. It was kind of tricky... I struggled a lot to get the containers in the right order...
If i had more time I would work more on the design, for examepl pictures or font.
